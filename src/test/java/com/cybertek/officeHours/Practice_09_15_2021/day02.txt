Today's Schedule

   - JUnit5
   - TestBase
   - WebDriverFactory
   - ImplicitWait vs Thread.sleep
   - moneyGaming Task
   - Locating Dynamic Elements
   - Xpath vs CSS
   - Alerts


  == JUnit5 ==
  - it is a UNIT TESTING FRAMEWORK
  - write and run repetable automated TCs
  - JUnit allows us to run, organize tCs , it can assertions
  - NO more main method

  Is Junit the only unit test framework ?

  - Java -- TestNG - JUnit5
  - Python -- PyTest
  - C# -- Nunit
  ...

  Annotations
    - Used for change behaviour of method

  Common Annotations

    @Test
        - This will make Java method a JUnit test
        - Every test will run independently (default)
        - If one test is fail ,it will not effect other ones

    @BeforeEach/@AfterEach
        - This annotions will run method ONCE before/after @Test
        - we can store here re-usable code
                - driver setuop
                - waits
                - quit/close driver

    @BeforeAll/@AfterAll

        - Regardless of how many test cases we have , this code will RUN ONLY ONCE


 Assertions
    - Verify actual and expected
    - it will a result (PASS OR FAIL)


NOTE :- Whether test case fail or not , before and after annotations will executed always

      - If assertions fail Rest of the line after assertion in same testwill not executed

        @Test
        public void test1(){
        code fragment
        Assertions.assertTrue(false);   // fail
        code fragment will not run

        }


TestBase
    -  TestBase is a class we create it as parent of all tests
    -  To store all common logic
    -  Why make it abstract ?
            - Because we want to avoid object creation from this class



WebDriverFactory
    - Used for create driver Object according to browserType


Implicit Wait

    - This wait only works for before findElement EVERYTIME.So we can put it inside BeforeEach
    - This is a selenium waits
    - It will wait until element is located

findElement

        1- if element is found it wil return WebElement
        2- if element is not found
            - it will check ImplicitlyWait
                YES : it will keep trying to locate element up to time  we set
                    - if it finds it inside this time it will return WebElemnt
                    - Otherwise it  will throw NSE (No Such Element)

                NO :  it  will throw NSE (No Such Element)


Thread.sleep vs Implicit Wait

Thread.sleep
    - it comes from Java
    - it will wait whole duration (it is static )

Implicit Wait
    - it comes from Selenium
    - it is dynamic wait


XPATH vs CSS

- Xpath can do more than CSS but xpath is little complex
- CSS is slightly faster than Xpath in IE
- CSS is easy to write and read (clear syntax )


1 - Locating elements with text
    XPATH : //tagNAme[. or text()='Value']
    CSS   :  NA

2- Css can not find drom matches based on index (different parents )
    XPATH : (Xpath Formula)[indexNumber]
    CSS   : it is not allowed

3- CSS can not locate child to parent
    XPATH : /.. --> move to Parent
    CSS   :    NA


Alerts

    1- HTML Alerts
        - We can handle as regular way

    2- Js Alerts
        - We need to use Alert interface from Selenium to handle
        - type of Js Alert
            1- Information  --> ONLY accept
            2- Confirmation --> Accept or Dismiss
            3- Prompt       --> accept / sendkeys / dismiss

            getText()   -- > we can use for all them
